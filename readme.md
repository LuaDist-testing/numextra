# Numeric Extra

## About

Numeric Extra is a collection of (unofficial) complementary functions
for [Numeric Lua][1]. It provides some basic statistical functions like var,
corr, std, ..., principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis.
Also, this library provides some additional functions to ease matrix handling.

As Numeric Lua, Numeric Extra is also licensed under the MIT license and
can be freely used for academic and commercial purposes.

## Dependencies

Numeric Extra depends on Numeric Lua. Some examples use [lua-gnuplot][3] too.

## Install

Numeric extra is a pure Lua library. To install it, copy the numextra folder and
the numextra.lua file into your Lua shared folder (eg, /usr/share/lua/5.1).
You can also use the published Lua rock.

## Documentation

The documentation is located at doc/html and can be generated again
with [badoc][4].
